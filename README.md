# DeepLearning
Implementation of DL Concepts in Python
Currently contains:
  1. A simple neural network with manually tunable parameters(1 hidden layer), optimized with different learning algorithms
  2. SGD, SGD with Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam.
  3. An MLP using Tensorflow(Simple code, easy to follow along).
  4. An MLP using Theano(Simple code, easy to follow along).
  5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using NumPy, implemented in a Keras-like interface.
