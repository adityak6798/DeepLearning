# DeepLearning
Implementation of DL Concepts in Python
Currently contains:
  1. A simple neural network with manually tunable parameters(1 hidden layer), optimized with different learning algorithms
  2. SGD, SGD with Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam.
  3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using NumPy, implemented in a Keras-like interface.
